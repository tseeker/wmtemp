Make sure lm_sensors is installed, it will not work without it.

You might want to take a look at the Makefile to change an include path or
library path.

* Install with the following commands:

    make
    su
    make install


The default install path is /usr/local/bin, if you do not want this, use

    make DEST=/to/another/path install

to install wmtemp to /to/an/other/path.

To install the manual page to another location (default is
/usr/local/share/man/man1), use:

    make MAN=/to/another/path install

Or combine the above :).

* Check out `wmtemp --help` for options.

* See the file COPYING for license information
