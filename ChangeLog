0.0.6 (2008-04-28)
* Riccardo Stagni <unriccio@email.it> (the current Debian maintainer of this
  package) submitted a patch fixing some syntactic stuff in the -h output

0.0.5 (2005-06-23)
* Found out Debian (http://www.debian.org/) has a package and the maintainer
  has added a manual page, which I've shamelessly copied. Only the part
  explaining this package had no manual page is removed, since it's no longer
  true :). Thanks to Lars Steinke <lss@debian.org> for maintaining the Debian
  package.

0.0.4 (2004-03-12)
* Fixed a small bug in the Makefile, probably caused by an older version of
  sed, which caused gcc to complain about extra characters after an #include
  when compiling the xpms. Again thanks to Jean Delvare for pointing this out.

0.0.3 (2004-03-10)
* Modified the background_off.xpm image a bit, so it would be more consistent
  with WMCPULoad and WMMemLoad (more shadow at the borders)
* Added a flag to show temperatures in Fahrenheit
* Added a flag to show temperatures in Kelvin
* Modified the digit code so it could show values greater than 100
* Modified the build system, so XPMs are build seperately instead of included
  in the main.c file
* Stripped all long arguments, they are quite useless and take more effort to
  type
* Do not wait <interval> seconds before the first update, just update, then
  enter the main loop.
* Removed the optimization options for Pentium 4, not everybody has a Pentium
  4 to play with :). Also made de CFLAGS a bit more conservative.
* Some textual changes in the help output, thanks to Jean Delvare
  (http://www.ensicaen.ismra.fr/~delvare/) for pointing that out.

0.0.2 (2004-03-08)
* Added a couple of options, so CPU and SYS features could be swapped or
  entirely customized
* Added README, COPYING and AUTHORS files and made the package

0.0.1 (2004-03-08)
* Stripped WMMemLoad to the bones and replaced the memory statistics code
  with temperature statistics code, obtained from libsensors (a part of
  the lm_sensors package
